"This project utilizes YOLOv5 for face detection in images. It leverages a pre-trained model and Google Colab for easy setup and execution. Users can upload images and detect faces with a specified confidence threshold."  I focused on the core functionality of the project and its dependencies (YOLOv5, pre-trained model, Google Colab).
